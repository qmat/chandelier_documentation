3D model
--------

This_ directory contains a Rhino [#]_ model and several screenshots of the initial design of the chandelier. It shows two rings of the 17 inch Hannstar HSD170ME13 panels, although in the final product the outer ring is made up out of 19 inch screens.

Rigging
------

The screens hang from the ring with nylon straps. The ring is held up by four 5mm steel wires and the two are connected by a small nylon sling and Reutlingers. The steel wires finally connect to the I-beams with shackles and long slings. This repository also contains the safety_ documentation.
